Introduction
*************
pySeqRNA is an automated python package for RNASeq data analysis.

Today, massive amounts of data are generated by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. 
In recent years, many algorithms, statistical methods, and software tools have been developed 
to perform the individual analysis steps of various NGS applications. However, streamlined analysis
remains a significant barrier to effectively utilizing the technology. We have developed a 
Python package (pySeqRNA) that allows fast, efficient, manageable, and reproducible RNA-Seq
analysis. It effectively uses current software and tools with newly written Python scripts 
without confining users to a collection of pre-defined methods and environments by combining 
many command-line tools and custom Python scripts.
